File Pool

About:
File Pool is a program created to sync and distribute files across multiple computers ensuring that
each computer has the latest version of any distributed file. In a way this would be Dropbox but it
is not simply due to the fact that this, while similar, is a wildly different concept. The goal of
File Pool is not to sync files across YOUR computers but to sync files across everybody else's.

Note:
All user accounts are stored in directories respectively named after their ID.
